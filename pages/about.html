        <div class="about-content">
          <p>Thulani Mtsuki Attorneys is a committed legal practice based in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga, dedicated to providing dedicated, efficient and effective legal services to suit your pocket. We believe that every person - regardless of their background or circumstances — deserves skilled, honest legal representation.</p>
          <p>Mr Mtsuki commenced his practical legal experience in 1995, working as a Personal Assistant for Mokobe &amp; Dulamo Attorneys before joining Van Heerden &amp; Brummer Inc as an Associate and later being appointed as Director. The firm was established in 1997 and has since grown into one of the most trusted legal practices in the region.</p>
          <p>As an admitted attorney of the High Court of South Africa, Thulani Mtsuki brings decades of courtroom experience and thorough legal knowledge across a broad range of practice areas — from family and divorce law and criminal defence, to High Court, Regional and Magistrate's Court litigation, commercial and mining law, municipal law, and estate administration. Clients work directly with Mr Mtsuki throughout their matter, not junior staff or assistants.</p>
          <p>Mr Mtsuki has also served his community extensively — as former Chairperson of the Mpumalanga Township Board, former counsellor and chairperson of the Mpumalanga Attorneys Association, and as a former member of the Legal Practice Council. He serves or has served on the boards and trusts of Emalahleni Child Welfare, Reach For Life (AIDS Organisation), New Life Children's Home, St. Thomas Aquinas Private School Board, Uthuli Mining &amp; Supplies (PTY) LTD, and Emalahleni Mining Colliery.</p>
          <p><strong>Pensioners receive a 50% discount</strong> on legal fees — because everyone deserves access to justice.</p>
